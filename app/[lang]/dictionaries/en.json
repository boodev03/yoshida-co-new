In 1961, we became the first company in Japan to design and manufacture gloveboxes, marking our entry into the nuclear industry.\n\nOur strength lies in our in-house integrated production system, where design, fabrication/welding, and machining departments work closely together. This allows us to create products that fully meet our customers’ needs.\n\nIn recent years, we have been actively engaged in research and development, collaborating with universities, research institutions, and venture companies on a variety of projects. These include the development of next-generation gloveboxes with remote operation capabilities and the verification of separation methods for organic solvents used at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. We are also exploring new ways to apply our proprietary technologies, such as adapting the shielding and containment techniques developed during the Fukushima decommissioning work for use in fields like medicine and aerospace.\n\nWe strive to be the company our customers turn to when they face challenges, and we will continue to build a system that enables us to fully realize their requirements.\n\nThank you for your continued support.",
